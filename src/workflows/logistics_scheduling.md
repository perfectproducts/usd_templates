# Logistics Simulation Case Study

Fred is a logistics expert and has to evaluate different scenarios to elevate a bottleneck with forklifts and a storage location.

He is not very used to CAD tools or simulation  environments so he just needs to know if a given scenario is better than the other. He's not too much interested in 3D but wouldn't mind as well to see it to validate the results.

Alex helps him using the SyncTwin App to

* Import Material- and Container-Catalog

* Import Transport-Item-Catalog

* Model existing situation

* Model new alternatives
