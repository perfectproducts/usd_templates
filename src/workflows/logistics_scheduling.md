# Logistics Simulation Case Study

Fred from logistics has to evaluate different scenarios to resolve a bottleneck with a automated storage facility. 
He has thought of adding a block storage and a rack storage element to his layout but is not sure what configuration is best. 

He is not very used to CAD tools or simulation environments so he just needs to know if a given scenario is better than the other. 
He's not too much interested in 3D but wouldn't mind as well to see it to validate the results.

Alex helps him using the SyncTwin App to

* Import Material- and Container-Catalog

* Import Transport-Item-Catalog

* Model existing situation

* Model new alternatives
