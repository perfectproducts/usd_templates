# Industrial Metaverse Specs

In this Chapter we are introducing our SyncTwin Data Specifications to enable the Industrial Metaverse. We created these specifications with the purposes to make it as easy as possible to 
generate manufacturing digital twins. Beginning with the representation of the products you would like to produce and ending with a holistic digital twin of your manufacturing assets and processes.

## Basic Concept

To be able to create a real holistic digital twin of a manufacturing factory with its processes it is necessary to gather all data (production, assembly, worker scheduling, etc.) in one
common language and a combined platform. This language is the Universal Scene Description (USD) and the platform is our SyncTwin App which is build on top of Nvidia Omniverse which itself
makes USD and its features accesible to everybody. Since every piece of your data should be in an ideal case represented as USD we provice a digital twin pipeline which should make it easy
for you to bring for example excel-files into the SyncTwin App.

As always there a lots of ways to start but for now we start by introducing the high level company folder structure to give you an overview.
