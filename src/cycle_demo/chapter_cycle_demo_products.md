# Products

First of all to show your products and their variations to potential customers you need to bring them into the SyncTwin Omniverse App. For that we prepared two products for you:

1. [product_P3_basicbike](https://github.com/perfectproducts/usd_templates/blob/main/src/cycle_demo/assets/products/product_P3_basicbike.zip)
2. [product_P2_unicycle](https://github.com/perfectproducts/usd_templates/blob/main/src/cycle_demo/assets/products/product_P2_unicycle.zip)

Download one or both. Lets assume you downloaded product_P3_basicbike.

- Extract the folder into your your_project/products
- The structure should look like this: your_project/products/product_P3_basicbike/product_P2_unicycle.usd and your_project/products/product_P3_basicbike/SubUSDs

If you open the product_P2_unicycle.usd in your Omniverse Usd Composer you are going to see a bike which is your product you want to show your customers. There are different variations implemented by using Variant Sets and Variants. If you want to know more about Variant Sets and Variants visit: https://perfectproducts.github.io/usd_templates/usd_concepts/variant_sets_and_variants.html
