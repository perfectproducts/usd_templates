# Cycle Demo

In this chapter, we delve into a demonstrative scenario illustrating the dynamic capabilities of the product configurator within the industrial metaverse. Through a simple yet relatable use case based on bicycles and unicycles, we aim to bridge the complex world of digital twinning with everyday understanding.

Lets say you are a cycle vendor who wants to sell two cycles. A bicycle and unicycle. Of course your products have different variants. You decide to show these products and their variations to potential customers via our SyncTwin Omniverse App.

Assuming you got Omniverse already installed we recommend to start out with the following folder structure:

- your_project/configurators
- your_project/products

We are going to fill these folders step by step to explain how to set up products and how the product configurator works.
